# STA141b-Final-Project
#"This is a base stat checker for pokemons since the generation-7.
             I use the data from pokeapi.co. The site contains most of the infomration for pokemon; however, there
               are some pokemons' data from gen-3 to gen-7 are missing, so the app
               aren't have all the pokemons' available since gen-3 to gen-7. (If you selected
                a pokemon that do not has data, the app you display only errors.)"
